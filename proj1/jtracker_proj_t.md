## Grading Rubric

Prepare a markdown table with **three** columns:

- Column1 has all the following points PLUS all the points from the
  [Software Sustainability Evaluation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0ccsVdN-nXJCHLluJ-hANZlp8rDKgprJa0oTYiLZSDxh3DA/viewform).
- Column2 is your self-assessment. For each items, score yourself zero (none), one (a litte), two (somewhat), three (a lot).
- Column3 is for any links you  are adding to support your claim in column two.
- At the top, show the sum of column2
