This essay aims to describe the process Team 54 went through to select a project using the [ rubric](https://github.com/txt/se23/blob/main/docs/project2.md), manage the installation, and overcome challenges that arose along the way.

One of our goals throughout this process was to ensure fair workload distribution among all team members. To that end, we allocated the task of grading one complete project, along with a fourth of another, to each team member. Although some initial deadlines had to be moved due to some schedule conflicts, the team established good communication, and deliverables were handled in a timely manner. During the grading process, team members met several times and discussed the ambiguities and unclear rubric items. There were two challenges at this stage for team members: 
1) the description of certain rubric items was either new or unclear to the team.
2) finding the appropriate evidence to support some scores was not straightforward.

Following some individual research of each team member on rubrics and their group discussions, we resolved the uncertainties and finished the scoring process. This process was valuable for the whole team since these rubrics will serve as grading rubrics for the future phases of the project. So, its complete understanding will help in building criteria for assessing the next stages. Finally, based on the scores of projects and what interested the team more, we selected a project called “Auto Anki” for further development and started the installation process. What made this project particularly intriguing was its goal to turn any course slides into Anki flashcards, which can be helpful for students.

After we chose the Auto Anki project, we followed the provided instructions diligently to run it, but encountered some challenges during the project setup. While the video tutorial contained the necessary commands, it would have been more convenient if all of the commands were included in the 'install.md' file for easy reference since there was no guidance for Mac users on how to install the project.
Upon attempting to run the project, we encountered a 'ModuleNotFoundError' related to the 'docx2pdf' module. To address this, we executed the 'pip install' command for 'docx2pdf.' However, we then encountered our third error: "Cannot uninstall appscript." We tried to choose another way which didn’t need uninstalling appscript but our attempt to use the 'brew' command to install 'docx2pdf' was unsuccessful. Consequently, we opted for a manual uninstallation approach for the appscript.
We initiated the uninstallation process by utilizing the 'pip show appscript' command. After successfully removing 'appscript,' we were able to install 'docx2pdf.' However, another error impede our progress, preventing us from running the code; it displayed an "Illegal hardware instruction" message. This issue stemmed from one of the libraries being incompatible with Mac M1.
To pinpoint the problematic library, we inserted a random message before each library call. We identified the 'Spacy' library as the source of the error, which proved challenging to install using the provided Mac user commands. We also attempted another suggested method to install all dependencies for Mac users, so that we can install Stacy, but it yielded no success.
Our next steps involved clearing the 'pip' cache and uninstalling and reinstalling 'thinc.' Finally, we successfully installed 'Spacy,' resolving the issue at hand and then we could run the program.
The pain experienced in the project could have been avoided through proactive measures and improved team members collaboration. To prevent installation challenges, comprehensive documentation, including all necessary commands and troubleshooting tips, should be readily accessible in an 'install.md' file. Early communication among team members helps address scheduling conflicts and ensures timely deliverables. Also, we should make a plan that helps us do the tasks as a team earlier.. Also we should encourage team members to research unfamiliar concepts to enhance project understanding. And we should make a friendly environment for all members to ask their questions if they don’t know parts of the project or are not used to a special tool that all group members agreed to use. Also, collaborative problem-solving should be integral to the project process, allowing the team to address issues promptly. Lastly, having backup plans for unforeseen challenges can help keep the project on track.
